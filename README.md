#Arcade game
My third project on Udacity's Front-End Dev Nanodegree.

So here's a version of the Frogger game. 
When loading the page, you'll reach the Menu Screen where you'll be able to choose the character you want to play with. Select the character with LEFT and RIGHT arrows of your keyboard, then press ENTER to begin the game.

#Game Screen
Move your character on the screen with your keyboard's arrows (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)

YOUR GOAL : collect as many gems as possible without colliding with the bugs which are your enemies. Grass area is safe, stone paths ARE NOT! ;-P

You have 4 lives during the game, represented by the little hearts on the top right corner of the screen. Each collision with a bug takes one life away. Once all are gone, the game is over.

On collision with a bug, a little 'POOF!' image (designed by Freepik) will be displayed and the game will pause until you hit any arrow of your keyboard.

The number of gems collected during the game is shown on the top left corner of the screen. When the game is over, the highest score you reached - over all the games you played - appears on the Menu Screen, next to 'highscore'.
